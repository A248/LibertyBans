## Versioning

LibertyBans follows semantic versioning, with some additional clarifications as to the separation between the API, server-side usage, and database schema compatibility.

The format of a version is **Major**.**Minor**.**Patch**

The tables indicates possible changes, and the corresponding changes to versioning. For example, `Breaking API change` corresponds to a new major version (ex: 4.0 -> 5.0), so the versioning is 'major version'.

Note that the presence of a version does not necessarily mean that the changes which require that version will be present. For example, there can be a new major version without breaking schema changes.

### API
| Change | Versioning Change | Description |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Breaking API change             | Major | *Binary*-incompatible or behavior-incompatible changes to the API.                     |
| Compatible API feature addition | Minor | Backwards-binary-compatible and behavior-compatible addition to the API. May be *source*-incompatible in rare cases   |
| Implementation bug-fixes        | Patch | Bugs fixed |

### Database Schema

Database schema changes only matter if you are doing one of the following:
1. Running on a multi-proxy setup
2. Running a single-proxy setup where LibertyBans is placed on the backend servers
3. Running an external program which connects to the database, for example a web interface

Assuming no external programs are connected to the database, single servers and single-proxy servers where LibertyBans is placed on the proxy do not need to be concerned with database schema changes.

| Change | Versioning Change | Description |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Breaking database schema              | Major | Past versions of LibertyBans will not be able to read or use the new schema            |
| Compatible database schema change     | Minor | **The last minor release** of LibertyBans will be able to read and use the new schema. Previous minor releases of LibertyBans *may NOT* be able to read or use the new schema. For example, this means you can upgrade from 1.2.x to 1.3.x safely, but you *cannot* upgrade from 1.1.x to 1.3.x. You cannot safely have versions 1.1.x and 1.3.x co-existing at the same time. |

### Server-side Usage
| Change | Versioning Change | Examples |
| ------ | ----------------- | ----------- |
| Breaking server-side usage          | Major | Command re-names, permission changes, backwards-incompatible configuration changes |
| Compatible server-side usage change | Minor | Permission rename, but the old permission is still supported alongside the new one |
| Server-side usage feature addition  | Patch | New command added, new configuration option |

## Support


| Version                | Support Provided |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Latest released        | Always                 |
| Previous minor version | At least 1 month after the next minor version is released  |
| Previous major version | At least 4 months after the next major version is released |

Notes for previous versions:
* You must be on the most recent version *for that version*. For example, you cannot expect support for 1.4.2 if 1.4.3 has been released.
* Support may be slower than that for the latest version. If you are on the latest version, you are more likely to receive support *faster* and *from more users*.

There is no timeline for responding to support requests, but an effort will be made to respond within 3 days *at maximum*, ideally within 1 day.
