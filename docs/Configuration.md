The configuration is mostly self-explanatory.

### Syntax

LibertyBans uses familiar ".yml" files. Feel free to use [Online Yaml Parser](https://yaml-online-parser.appspot.com) to validate config files.

## Reloading Configuration

You can reload most of the configuration with:

```
/libertybans reload
```

You must have the necessary [permissions](Permissions) to do this.

### Restarting the plugin

For settings in sql.yml, and some other settings where documented, you need to either fully restart your server, or use LibertyBans' restart command:
```
/libertybans restart
```

### Addons

Installing [addons](Addons) requires a full server restart.
