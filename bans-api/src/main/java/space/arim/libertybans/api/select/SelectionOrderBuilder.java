	 * composite victim  OR its address matches the specified composite, then the selected victim is matched. <br>

	 * will match all composite victims whose UUID is <code>new UUID(1, 1)</code> OR whose address is
	 * 127.0.0.1. However, specifying a composite victim will <i>not</i> match other kinds of victims.
