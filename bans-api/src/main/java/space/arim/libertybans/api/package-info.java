/**
 * The base of the LibertyBans API. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Nullability</b> <br>
 * Unless stated otherwise, no method will return {@code null}. All nullability is explicitly mentioned in the javadoc,
 * therefore the lack of such mention implies the return value or method parameter in question will be or must be nonnull. <br>
 * <br>
 * This further implies all methods not declared to accept {@code null} parameters may throw {@code NullPointerException}
 * on null input. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Thread Safety</b> <br>
 * Generally, objects are immutable and thread safe. The only exception to this rule are <i>builder</i> objects, which
 * are mutable and <i>unsafe</i> for concurrent use. It is only intended for builders to be used from a single thread.
