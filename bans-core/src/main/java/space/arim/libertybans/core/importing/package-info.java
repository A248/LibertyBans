/**
 * Implements importing from other plugins. <br>
 * <br>
 * How punishment data is stored differs across plugins, especially with regards to UUIDs
 * and names. Importers for specific plugins implement {@link space.arim.libertybans.core.importing.ImportSource} <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>AdvancedBan</b> <br>
 * AdvancedBan has no dedicated persistent uuid/name cache. The plugin does store victim names
 * and UUIDs alongside each punishment. Also, it does not retain the operator uuid, but rather
 * uses operator names. This requires a lookup during the import process. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>LiteBans</b> <br>
 * LiteBans maintains a uuid and name store in litebans_history.
 * Additionally, it puts the victim name and uuid, and the operator name and uuid,
 * alongside each punishment. <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Self</b> <br>
 * The self-import process is intentionally special-cased. It has no ImportSource implementation
 * but rather uses {@link space.arim.libertybans.core.importing.SelfImportProcess}
 *
