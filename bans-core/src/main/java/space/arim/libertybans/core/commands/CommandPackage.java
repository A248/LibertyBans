 * 1. Iterative methods: next, hasNext, and peek.
 * 2. Aggregate methods: allRemaining
 * 3. Hidden argument methods: findHiddenArgument <br>
 * <br>
 * Normal command arguments are accessible via normal iteration (next, hasNext, and peek). <br>
 * <br>
 * There are also hidden arguments, which are not viewable through
 * normal iteration methods. If they have not yet been encountered, hidden arguments are
 * visible through aggregate methods; if they have been encountered, hidden arguments
 * can be accessed with {@link #findHiddenArgument(String)}. A hidden argument is considered
 * "encountered" if the process of iteration has passed the argument in its course.
