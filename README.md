## Introduction

Free software and high quality, LibertyBans is the best-designed punishment plugin. It can efficiently scale to large networks and operate on single servers with minimal resources.

### Design

* Effective and lightweight. No complicated installation and avoids unnecessary features.
* Option to use local file-based database (HyperSQL), or remote database (MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
* Enhanced database-oriented performance emphasising calculations in SQL. Low memory usage because punishments are stored almost completely in the database. Data is stored in minimal form as raw bytes instead of strings.
* Best practices for asynchronous calculations are followed. The performance cost of context switching is understood and avoided; the plugin does not blindly fire async tasks.
* Designed for high availability and concurrency. Minimal locking is employed while keeping state consistent; this is mostly realised through the fact that most plugin state is maintained in the database itself.
* Well-structured API providing a framework for other plugins to work with the plugin.

### Features

* Add and remove punishments:
    * /ban, /ipban, /unban, /unbanip - bans or unbans a player or IP address
    * /mute, /ipmute, /unmute, /unmuteip - mutes or unmutes a player or IP address
    * /warn, /ipwarn, /unwarn, /unwarnip - warns or unwarns a player or IP address
    * /kick, /ipkick - kicks a player or IP address
* Temporary versions of bans, mutes, and warns
* All player data is stored using UUIDs. This isn't a silly plugin which stores data by player name.
* List punishments:
    * /banlist - shows all bans
    * /mutelist - shows all mutes
    * /history <player> - shows all punishments for a player
    * /warns <player> - shows all warns for a player
    * /blame <player> - shows all the punishments a staff member has enacted
* Multiple means to block alt accounts:
  * Automatic enforcement to block alt accounts. *By default, when using IP-bans, alts are automatically banned from joining if the main account is banned.* This behavior is configurable, and you can even increase the strictness of alt-checking.
  * Manual /alts command - shows suspected alt accounts for a player.
  * Alts notification on join - tells staff members when a player whose suspected alt is banned or muted.
* Options and behaviour are fully configurable. You can even tweak your connection pool and statement cache settings to fine-tune performance.
* Full multi-proxy and multi-instance support. You can place LibertyBans on the proxy if you use a single proxy, or on multiple backend servers.
* All dependencies are automatically downloaded with secure SHA-512 hashes used to validate the downloads. Additionally, builds of LibertyBans are reproducible from the source code, meaning checksums can be personally verified.

## Basic Info

### Requirements

* Java 11

Supported platforms:

* Spigot/Paper or any forks thereof
* BungeeCord
* Velocity

Compatibility with Geyser/Floodgate usernames.

### Installation

LibertyBans will work out-of-the-box for most users.

* When using a single proxy, it is recommended, but not required, to install LibertyBans on the proxy itself.
* LibertyBans can also be installed on the backend servers if you are willing to configure multi-instance synchronization.

For installing on the backend servers and synchronizing punishments, see the wiki for additional information.

### Developer API

The developer API is extensive. LibertyBans does not recommend developers mess with the database as a first recourse. [More information here](https://libertybans.org/#/Developer-API)
