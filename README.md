# LibertyBans
The be-all, end-all of discipline.

## Introduction

### Design

* Effective and lightweight. No complicated installation and avoids unnecessary features.
* Option to use local file-based database (HyperSQL), or remote database (MariaDB/MySQL).
* Enhanced database-oriented performance emphasising calculations in SQL. Low memory usage because punishments are stored almost completely in the database.
* Compact storage definitions. UUIDs are stored in minimal form as raw bytes instead of strings. Same for IP addresses.
* Best practices for asynchronous calculations are followed. The performance cost of context switching is understood and avoided; the plugin does not blindly fire async tasks.
* Designed for high availability and concurrency. Minimal locking is employed while keeping state consistent; this is mostly realised through the fact that most plugin state is maintained in the database itself.
* Well-structured API providing a framework for other plugins to work with the plugin.

### Features

* Add and remove punishments:
    * /ban, /ipban, /unban, /unbanip - bans or unbans a player or IP address
    * /mute, /ipmute, /unmute, /unmuteip - mutes or unmutes a player or IP address
    * /warn, /ipwarn, /unwarn, /unwarnip - warns or unwarns a player or IP address
    * /kick, /ipkick - kicks a player or IP address
* Temporary versions of bans, mutes, and warns
* All player data is stored using UUIDs. This isn't a silly plugin which stores data by player name.
* List punishments:
    * /banlist - shows all bans
    * /mutelist - shows all mutes
    * /history <player> - shows all punishments for a player
    * /warns <player> - shows all warns for a player
    * /blame <player> - shows all the punishments a staff member has enacted
* Multiple means to block alt accounts:
  * Automatic enforcement to block alt accounts. *By default, alts are automatically banned from joining if the main account is banned.* This behavior is configurable, and you can even increase the strictness of alt-checking. 
  * Manual /alts command - shows suspected alt accounts for a player.
  * Alts notification on join - tells staff members when a player whose suspected alt is banned or muted.
* Options and behaviour are fully configurable. You can even tweak your connection pool and statement cache settings to fine-tune performance.
* All dependencies are automatically downloaded with secure SHA-512 hashes used to validate the downloads. Additionally, builds of LibertyBans are reproducible from the source code, meaning checksums can be personally verified.

## Basic Info

### Requirements

* Java 11 (or higher)
* A compatible server platform

### Supported Platforms

* Spigot/Paper or any forks thereof
* BungeeCord
* Velocity

### Compatibility With

* Velocity 3.0, an upcoming version of Velocity (as of 26 June 2021).
* Geyser/Floodgate usernames.

### Installation

LibertyBans will work out-of-the-box for most users.

When using a proxy, it is recommend to install LibertyBans on the proxy itself. Do not install LibertyBans on both the backend servers and the proxy at the same time.

For more advanced setups (multi-proxy or installing on the backend servers), see the wiki for additional information.

## Developer API

The developer API is extensive. LibertyBans does not recommend developers mess with the database as a first recourse. [More information here](https://github.com/A248/LibertyBans/wiki/Developer-API)
